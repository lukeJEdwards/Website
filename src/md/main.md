## Object-oriented ontology

Object-oriented Ontology (OOO) has had the most significant impact on my work, shaping how I perceive and analyze the world around me. OOO's fundamental premise—that objects exist independently of human perception and possess their intrinsic properties and capacities—has profoundly influenced my approach to various disciplines, including philosophy, art, and technology.
In the contemporary landscape of philosophical inquiry, (OOO) has emerged as a compelling framework that reconfigures traditional understandings of objects and their relationships. My project explored OOO's rich and intricate realm, which posits that objects, ranging from the smallest particles to complex structures, exist independently of human perception and possess their intrinsic properties and capacities. By shifting the focus away from human-centric perspectives and acknowledging the autonomy and agency of objects, OOO challenges conventional ontological hierarchies and opens new avenues for exploring the interactions and interdependencies within a flat ontology. Through this lens, unravel the complex web of relations that objects inhabit, highlighting their profound implications across various disciplines, including art and technology.

## Videos Games

Exploring Object-oriented Ontology (OOO) through the lens of video games provides a unique and compelling perspective on the autonomy and agency of digital objects within virtual environments. Video games create intricate worlds populated by many objects, each with properties, behaviours, and interactions independent of player intervention. By analyzing these digital realms through the principles of OOO, we can appreciate how in-game objects—ranging from mundane items to complex characters and landscapes—exist and interact in ways that transcend their practical functions for the player. This approach allows us to see video games not merely as entertainment but as rich ontological spaces where objects possess a degree of agency and presence. Furthermore, OOO's emphasis on all objects' interconnectedness and equal footing encourages us to reconsider traditional narratives and hierarchies within game design, fostering more holistic and immersive experiences. Thus, OOO provides a robust framework for understanding and appreciating the intricate and often overlooked object relations that contribute to the depth and realism of video game worlds.
Video games have significantly impacted my work, offering a vivid and accessible illustration of OOO principles. Video games' dynamic and interactive nature makes them ideal for exploring how objects interact independently of human control, providing tangible examples of OOO's theoretical concepts. By engaging deeply with the ontological fabric of video game worlds, my research has gained valuable insights into the autonomy and agency of objects, ultimately enhancing my understanding and application of Object-oriented Ontology in broader contexts. Thus, OOO provides a robust framework for understanding and appreciating the intricate and often overlooked object relations that contribute to the depth and realism of video game worlds.

## Control (2019)

<img src="../assets/control-cover-art.jpg" width="100%"/>

In the video game "Control," Object-oriented Ontology (OOO) offers a profound framework for understanding the complex interplay of objects and environments that define the player's experience. "Control" immerses players in a world where non-linear time flow and a need to retrace steps become essential aspects of gameplay, emphasizing the autonomy and agency of objects within the game. The narrative structure, which eschews a straightforward progression, allows objects and spaces to reveal their significance and histories in a fluid, dynamic manner. This approach aligns with OOO's principle that objects exist independently of human perception, each possessing its temporal narrative that players must uncover through exploration and interaction.
One of the most striking manifestations of OOO in "Control" is the Service Weapon, a gun that changes its form physically to meet different needs. This transformative ability underscores the object's agency and versatility, emphasizing that it is not merely a tool for the player but an autonomous entity with its intrinsic properties and capacities. The Service Weapon's various forms—ranging from a pistol to a shotgun and beyond—highlight the object's role within the game's ontology, where it acts and reacts within the world of "Control" independently of the player's immediate desires.
The developers of "Control" also ingeniously utilized the game's physical space to enhance exploration through telekinesis. The Bureau of Control, with its shifting architecture and hidden passages, serves as an active participant in the narrative, challenging players to interact with it in innovative ways. Through telekinesis, players can manipulate the environment, moving objects to solve puzzles or uncover secrets, thus engaging with the world as a dynamic, responsive entity. This interaction exemplifies OOO's view that objects are not passive backdrops but active contributors to the narrative and gameplay experience.
In "Control," the seamless integration of non-linear time, the transformative Service Weapon, and the interactive environment through telekinesis demonstrates how OOO can be applied to video game design. It highlights the autonomy and agency of objects within the game world, creating a rich, immersive experience that encourages players to engage deeply with the ontological fabric of the virtual environment. Through this lens, "Control" becomes more than a game; it is a living, breathing world where objects and spaces possess their own stories and significance, independent of human intervention.

## Warframe (ongoing)

In the video game "Warframe," Object-oriented Ontology (OOO) provides a compelling framework for analyzing how Orkin artefacts and culture serve as vessels for preserving memories from the past. Within the game's expansive universe, the Orkin civilization is long gone, yet their artefacts and cultural remnants persist, exerting a profound influence on the present. OOO emphasizes the autonomy and agency of objects, suggesting that these Orkin relics exist and act independently of the human (or player) perspective, embodying their histories and significance. This imparticular, affected my work as it was somewhat reproducible in today's technology.
The Orkin artefacts in "Warframe" are not mere background elements but active participants in the game's narrative and gameplay. These objects, from architectural structures to personal relics, carry the weight of Orkin culture and history. By exploring and interacting with these artefacts, players uncover layers of the Orkin legacy, learning about their technological advancements, societal structures, and ultimate downfall. This process aligns with OOO's assertion that objects are repositories of their narratives, revealing their past through the interactions they foster in the present.

## Superhot (2016)

<img src="../assets/superhot.jpg" width="100%"/>
In Superhot, time only moves when the player moves, making the passage of time an autonomous object with its own set of rules and properties. This mechanic underscores the OOO notion that objects exist independently and possess their capacities. Time in Superhot is not just a background condition but an active participant in the game, shaping and being shaped by the player's actions. This autonomy of time challenges conventional perceptions and places it on equal footing with other objects in the game's ontology, creating a unique interplay where the player's movements and time are intertwined yet distinct entities.
The game also delves into meta-realities, where the in-game environment often blurs the lines between the virtual and the real world. This concept is portrayed through the game's narrative and increasingly abstract levels, where players are prompted to question the nature of their reality. Superhot cleverly uses this meta-narrative to explore the autonomy of objects and environments, emphasizing that digital objects within the game world have their existence and influence beyond mere virtual constructs. The game's meta-realities resonate with OOO's framework by illustrating that digital or physical objects exist within a network of relations that transcend simple categorizations of real and virtual.
By employing these mechanics, Superhot vividly illustrates OOO's principles in action. The game challenges players to rethink objects' nature and interactions, highlighting the independent existence and agency of time, environments, and in-game entities. This approach allows us to appreciate video games as rich ontological spaces where objects possess a degree of agency and presence, reinforcing the idea that digital objects in video games are not merely tools for entertainment but integral components of a complex ontological framework.

## They Live 1988

The movie They Live (1988) influenced the incorporation of polarizing glasses into my work. In this cult classic film directed by John Carpenter, the protagonist discovers a pair of sunglasses that reveal hidden messages and subliminal commands embedded in advertisements and media, exposing a hidden reality controlled by alien forces. The use of polarizing glasses to unveil obscured truths resonates deeply with the themes of perception and hidden realities, mirroring the principles of OOO that I employ in my work.
By revealing the hidden agendas behind seemingly innocuous advertisements, the glasses empower the protagonist to question the status quo and resist manipulation. Likewise, in my work informed by OOO, polarising glasses signify a commitment to interrogating conventional understandings of objects and their relationships, uncovering hidden truths and challenging established hierarchies. As such, They Live has been a powerful inspiration for integrating polarizing glasses into my artistic and philosophical endeavours, enriching my exploration of Object-oriented Ontology and its implications for understanding the world around us.

## 21st Mythology BBC Sound (2014)

"21st Century Mythologies" from BBC Radio 4 delves into examining contemporary myths and cultural phenomena through the lens of Roland Barthes' work. Barthes, in his essays collected in "Mythologies," scrutinizes seemingly ordinary objects and cultural practices, revealing the deeper meanings and ideologies they embody.
The transition from traditional cork stoppers to screw caps on wine bottles serves as a focal point for understanding broader societal shifts. This change reflects a practical alteration in packaging and symbolizes more significant transformations in consumer culture, authenticity, and tradition. Barthes' analysis highlights how mundane objects can become imbued with symbolic significance, shaping cultural narratives and practices.
Moreover, Barthes' critique of consumer culture and mass media underscores the pervasive influence of advertising and propaganda in shaping collective beliefs and desires. The rise of digital media amplifies these dynamics, as advertising copywriters and image makers wield significant influence over public perceptions and behaviours.
By scrutinizing contemporary myths and cultural practices, "21st Century Mythologies" prompts listeners to examine modern society's narratives and ideologies critically. Through this exploration, it becomes evident how myths shape our understanding of the world, influencing everything from consumer choices to political beliefs.
Overall, "21st Century Mythologies" has played a pivotal role in broadening my understanding of how objects function as carriers of meaning and ideology within society. The series has deepened my appreciation for the intricate web of relationships that define the ontological landscape, illuminating the implications of object-oriented thinking in diverse realms of human experience.
New materialism
New materialism, as a philosophical framework, shares significant conceptual overlaps with OOO, and exploring these connections can offer valuable insights into the ontological nature of the world. Near the end of my project, I began to delve into New materialism, recognizing its potential synergies with OOO and its capacity to enrich my understanding of object-oriented thinking.
At its core, New materialism emphasizes the active role of material entities in shaping the world and rejects the strict division between humans and non-humans inherent in traditional philosophical approaches. Similarly, OOO posits that all entities possess intrinsic properties and agency regardless of their material or conceptual nature. Both frameworks challenge anthropocentric perspectives, highlighting the agency and vitality of non-human entities and their interactions within the broader fabric of existence.
As I delved deeper into New materialism towards the end of my project, I began to recognize the potential synergies between these frameworks and the opportunities they present for advancing our understanding of ontology. By integrating insights from both perspectives, I aim to develop a more robust and nuanced understanding of the ontological nature of reality, one that acknowledges the active role of all entities in shaping the world we inhabit

## New England Red Kathleen Stewart

A book that helped me understand new materialism was New England Red by Kathleen Stewart—the novel delves into the complexities of rural life in New England. Kathleen explores themes of identity, community, and the interplay between individuals and their environments. The novel's setting in New England would provide a rich backdrop for examining the historical and cultural influences that shape the characters' lives. Stewart weaves personal stories with broader social and environmental themes, offering a nuanced portrait of life in a specific locale. Stewart's detailed attention to the material aspects of rural life—such as landscapes, buildings, and everyday objects—reflects the principles.
